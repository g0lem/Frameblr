Tumblr Framework for blogs

You can preview this theme [here](http://sasteve.tumblr.com/)

This was made for the purpose of having a simpler, nicely designed tumblr theme that can be adapted for different types of blogs fairly easy. This also ties in with another project I am curently working on, which I will disclose once it's up.


Features missing: 

- the reblog and favorite buttons
- better design for the search bar
- make the contact and subscribe buttons work

the links would also have to be probided as well, working on a way to do that
